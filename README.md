This is the replication package of the paper:

Pianta, S. & Brutschin, E. (2022). Emissions Lock-in, Capacity, and Public Opinion: How Insights from Political Science Can Inform Climate Modeling Efforts. Politics and Governance.

The R script "replication_script_pianta_brutschin_2022.R" allows replicting the figures and computations presented in the paper.

As the conditions of use of some of the datasets that we employed do not allow us to share them here, some data will need to be downloaded directly from online sources. In the R script, we provide links and detailed instructions to download them.

In the R script we also provide instructions on how to use the do files present on this repository that allow cleaning the Integrated Values Survey data ("ZA7503_EVS_WVS_Merge_Syntax.do" ; "EVS_Trend_File_1981-2017_ZA7503_missing.do", and "IVS_clean.do").
